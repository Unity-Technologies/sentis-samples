# Protein Folding Sample

Protein folding visualization demo showing how to render and visualize protein folding in real time 3D.

This demo is a simplified recreation of Alphafold (version 1) which won the CASP (2018) protein folding competition. 
It is based off this implementation: https://github.com/Urinx/alphafold_pytorch

The purpose of this demo is to demonstrate the Unity Sentis API and how it can be useful for scientific visualisation.
