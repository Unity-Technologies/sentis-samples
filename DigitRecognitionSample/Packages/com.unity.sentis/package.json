  "description": "The Sentis package is a neural network inference library for Unity. You can use Sentis to import trained neural network models into Unity, then run them in real time locally on any platform Unity supports and in the Editor. You can run models on the GPU or the CPU.\n\nYou can use Sentis to run models that do style transfer, generate assets, automate non-player character (NPC) logic, and much more\n\nVisit https://discussions.unity.com/c/10 for updates and resources on Sentis, including a full sample project.",
